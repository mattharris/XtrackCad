%description
XTrkCad is a CAD program for designing Model Railroad layouts.
XTrkCad supports any scale, has libraries of popular brands of x
turnouts and sectional track (plus you add your own easily), can
automatically use spiral transition curves when joining track
XTrkCad lets you manipulate track much like you would with actual
flex-track to modify, extend and join tracks and turnouts.

ruler, parts list, 99 drawing layers, undo/redo commands,
benchwork, 'Print to BitMap', elevations, train simulation and
car inventory.
