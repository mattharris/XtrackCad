\S{cmdEasement} \i{Easements}

Easements are special sections of gradually curving track used to connect straight and curved tracks (or two curved tracks). Easements reduce the effects of sudden changes in track curves which can cause jerky motion and derailments.

Easements can be created every time you \f{Join} (\K{cmdJoin}) tracks, \f{Extend} (\K{extendTrack}) a track or create a \f{Tangent} (\K{createTangent}) track.

When using easements, an error message will be generated if tracks have a radius that is too small or are too short for the transition curve.

The \f{Easement} dialog is invoked from the Options (\K{optionM}) menu.

\dd \G{png.d/easew.png}

\u000

\dd \f{Value} - allows fine tuning of the easement parameters (restricted to values >= 0.5).

\u000

\dd \f{R} - minimum radius of the curved track.

\u000

\dd \f{X} - offset between a straight and curved track.

\u000

\dd \f{L} - length of the transition track.

\u000

\dd Radio button group with \f{None}, \f{Sharp}, \f{Normal} and \f{Broad}. Corresponding \f{Value}s for these buttons are 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0. Select \f{None} to turn easements off.

The values \f{R}, \f{X} and \f{L} are read-only.

These values indicate the worst case of joining a straight track with a curve of radius \f{R}. The two tracks are separated by the offset \f{X} while the easement curve extends for \f{L/2} inches or centimeters to each side of the endpoints.

The formula used to draw easements is:

\c          x = l * l * l / (6 * R * L)
\e                               b   b
\c          r = L * R/l
\e              b   b

where

\b \f{l} is the distance along the tangent to the easement.

\b \f{R} is the final radius of the easement.

\b \f{L} is the total length of the easement along the tangent.

\b \f{x} is the offset from the tangent at \f{l}.

\b \f{r} is the radius of easement curve at \f{l}.

The Easement Button (\G{png.d/beasement.png}) on the Main Window (\K{mainW}) changes its label to indicate the current easement value.

The following diagrams illustrates the \f{R}, \f{X} and \f{L} values and the resulting easement curve.

\G{png.d/easeex1.png}

\G{png.d/easeex2.png}

If curves with a radius larger than \f{R} or two curves (that bend in the same direction) are being connecting then the easement curve will be shorter and the offset smaller.  If the computed offset is small then no easement is generated.  

A curved track that bends in one direction and then bends in the opposite direction is an \e{S-curve}.  This will generate the worst case easement which is two easement curves placed end to end.

Refer to instruction in \k{EasementsSectional} when using sectional track.

\rule


\S2{EasementsSectional} \i{Easements and Sectional Track}

Easements require the possibility of creating track with arbitrary radii. Therefore easements are not possible if sectional track is used. It is best to turn \f{Easements} off when using sectional track.

\S{cmdPref} Preferences Dialog

This dialog controls some parameters which likely will not be changed frequently.

\dd \G{png.d/pref.png}

\u000

\dd \f{Angles} - controls the angle system. \f{Polar}: 0\u00B0 is up and angles are measured clockwise, or \f{Cartesian}: 0\u00B0 is to the right and angles are measured counter-clockwise.

\dd \f{Connection Angle} - as below for Connection Distance for the angle between endpoints.

\u000

\dd \f{Connection Distance} - the maximum distance between endpoints that can be connected.  This affects the \f{Join} (\K{cmdJoin}) command and auto-connection during \f{Parallel} (\K{cmdParallel}) commands and placing \f{Turnouts} (\K{cmdHotBar}).  The default value for this field is 0.100 inches or 0.254 CM. Changing this value is not recommended.

\u000

\dd \f{Drag Distance} - controls how far you can move the cursor (in pixels) before \e{XTrackCAD} considers the action to be a drag instead of a click.

\dd \f{Units} - choose between English (inches) or Metric (centimeters) measurements.

\S{cmdSticky} Sticky Dialog

By default, when commands complete, the defined \f{Default Command} (\K{cmdCmdopt}) becomes active.  If a command is \f{sticky}, the defined \f{Default Command} is ignored and the current command remains active after completion.

The \f{Sticky} dialog controls which commands remain active after completion.
