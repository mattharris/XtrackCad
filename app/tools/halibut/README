HALIBUT Readme

This site also has the full documentation.

XTrkCad Modifications
---------------------

The following changes have been made:

1. Backends - only the HTML backend is included

2. \f: Emphasize more
	This formating instruction is similar to the \e. It is usually rendered
	as bold on HTML
	
	Example: Here is some \f{bold text}.
	
	Nesting of \e and \f is unsupported.
	
3 \G: Include graphic
	This instruction is used to include bitmaps into the document. Note that
	there are no checks for presence of the file nor whether its a valid
	graphics format. 
	
	\G just takes the filename as a parameter.
	
	Example: Include a bitmap here \G{png.d/bitmap.png}.
