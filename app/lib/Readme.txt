About XTrackCad

XTrackCad is a powerful CAD program for designing Model Railroad
layouts.

Some highlights:

-   Easy to use.
-   Supports any scale.
-   Supplied with parameter libraries for many popular brands of
    turnouts, plus the capability to define your own.
-   Automatic easement (spiral transition) curve calculation.
-   Extensive help files and video-clip demonstration mode.

Availability: XTrkCad Fork is a project for further development of the
original XTrkCad software. See the project homepage at

INSTALLATION


Windows

XTrackCad has only been tested on Windows 7.

The MS-Windows version of XTrackCad is shipped as a self-extracting/
self-installing program using the NSIS Installer from Nullsoft Inc.

Using Windows Explorer, locate the directory in which you downloaded or
copied your new version of XTrackCAD.

Start the installation program by double clicking on the
[XTRKCAD-SETUP-4.2.4.EXE][] file icon.

Follow the steps in the installation program.

The installation lets you define the directory into which XTrackCAD is
installed. The directory is created automatically if it doesn't already
exist.

A program folder named XTrackCAD 4.2.4 will be created during the
installation process. This folder contains the program, documentation,
parameter and example files. An existing installation of earlier
versions of XTrackCad is not overwritten.

A new program group named XTrackCad 4.2.4 will be created in the Start
menu.


Linux

XTrackCAD for LINUX is shipped as a RPM file and a self extracting
archive. You will need libc6, X11R6, GTK+2.0, webkitgtk.

Installing from the RPM package.

Use your operating system's package manager to install XTrackCAD.

Installing from the self-extracting archive.

After downloading open a command line then

    ./xtrkcad-setup-4.2.4.x86_64.sh --prefix=/ --exclude-subdir

This will install the executable in /usr/local/bin. A directory named
xtrkcad will be created in /usr/local/share and all files will be
unpacked into it.

If you install XTrackCAD into another directory, set the XTRKCADLIB
environment variable to point to that directory.

BUILDING


Overview

The following instructions detail building XTrackCAD using CMake. CMake
is a cross-platform build system, available at http://www.cmake.org,
that can be used to generate builds for a variety of build tools ranging
from "make" to Visual Studio and XCode. Using CMake you can build
XTrackCAD on Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OSX using the build tool(s) of
your choice.

Building XTrackCAD on GNU/Linux

-   Obtain the current sources from Mercurial; I assume that they are
    stored locally at "~/src/xtrkcad". Note that the correct URL for
    read-only access to Mercurial is
    http://xtrkcad-fork.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/xtrkcad-fork/xtrkcad
-   Create a separate build directory; for these instructions I assume
    that your build directory is "~/build/xtrkcad".
-   Run CMake from the build directory, passing it the path to the
    source directory:

    $ cd ~/build/xtrkcad $ ccmake ~/src/xtrkcad

-   Press the "c" key to configure the build. After a few moments you
    will see four options to configure: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE,
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, XTRKCAD_USE_GTK, and XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO.
-   Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to control the build type. Enter "Debug" for a
    debug build, "Release" for a release build, etc.
-   Use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to control where the software will be
    installed. For this example, I assume "~/install/xtrkcad".
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_GETTEXT to add new locales (language translations).
    Choose "OFF" to use XTrackCAD's default language (English). Refer to
    http://www.xtrkcad.org/Wikka/Internationalization for
    additional information.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK to control the user-interface back-end. Choose
    "OFF" for Windows, "ON" for all other platforms.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO to enable optional high-quality
    antialiased Cairo rendering for the GTK back-end. This option has no
    effect unless you are using the GTK back-end.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_DOXYGEN to enable the production of type, function,
    etc., documentation from the the source code. Requires doxygen if
    enabled. Enable if and only if you intend to hack on the code.
-   If you made any changes, press the "c" key again to update your
    new configuration.
-   Once everything is configured to your satisfaction, press the "g"
    key to generate makefiles for your build.
-   Compile XTrkCad using your new build:

    $ make

-   Install the new binary:

    $ make install

-   Run the installed binary:

    $ ~/install/xtrkcad/bin/xtrkcad

-   If XTRKCAD_USE_DOXYGEN was enabled:

    $ make docs-doxygen

to create the internals documentation. Read this documentation by
pointing your web browser at
~/build/xtrkcad/docs/doxygen/html/index.html.

Building XTrackCAD on Mac OSX

-   You will need to install the following dependencies - I recommend
    using http://www.macports.org to obtain them:
-   GTK2
-   webkit
-   gnome-icon-theme
-   Once the prerequisites are installed the build instructions are the
    same as for the GNU/Linux build, above.
-   Remember that to run XTrackCAD on OSX, you need to have X11 running
    with your DISPLAY set.

Building XTrackCAD on Windows

-   Obtain the current sources from Mercurial; I assume that they are
    stored locally at "c:/src/xtrkcad". Note that the correct URL for
    read-only access to Mercurial is
    http://xtrkcad-fork.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/xtrkcad-fork/xtrkcad
-   Use the Windows Start menu to run CMake (cmake-gui).
-   Specify the source and build directories in the CMake window. You
    must provide a build directory outside the source tree - I
    use "c:/build/xtrkcad".
-   Press the "Configure" button to configure the build. You will be
    prompted for the type of build to generate. Choose your desired
    tool - I used "Visual Studio 10". After a few moments you will see
    three options to configure: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, XTRKCAD_USE_GTK,
    and XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO.
-   Use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to control where the software will be
    installed. The default "c:/Program Files/XTrkCAD" is a good choice.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_GETTEXT to add new locales (language translations).
    Choose "OFF" to use XTrackCAD's default language (English). Refer to
    http://www.xtrkcad.org/Wikka/Internationalization for
    additional information.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK to control the user-interface back-end. Choose
    "OFF" for Windows.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO to enable optional high-quality
    antialiased Cairo rendering for the GTK back-end. This option has no
    effect unless on Windows.
-   Use XTRKCAD_USE_DOXYGEN to enable the production of type, function,
    etc., documentation from the the source code. Requires doxygen if
    enabled. Enable if and only if you intend to hack on the code.
-   If you made any changes, press the "Configure" button again to
    update your new configuration.
-   Once everything is configured to your satisfaction, press the "OK"
    button to generate project files for your build.
-   Compile XTrackCad using the new project files. For example, start
    MSVC and open the "XTrkCAD.sln" solution file which is located in
    your build directory.
-   Build the "BUILD_ALL" project to build the software.
-   Build the "INSTALL" project to install the software.
-   Run XTrackCAD by double-clicking its icon located in the install
    directory - for example: c:/Program Files/XTrkCAD/bin/xtrkcad.exe.
