# Installation #
## Windows ##

XTrackCad has only been tested on Windows 7. 

The MS-Windows version of XTrackCad is shipped as a self-extracting/
self-installing program using the NSIS Installer from Nullsoft Inc.

Using Windows Explorer, locate the directory in which you downloaded or copied your new version of XTrackCAD.

Start the installation program by double clicking on the 
**[xtrkcad-setup-4.2.4.exe][]** file icon.

Follow the steps in the installation program.

The installation lets you define the directory into which XTrackCAD is 
installed. The directory is created automatically if it doesn't already exist.

A program folder named XTrackCAD 4.2.4 will be created during the installation 
process. This folder contains the program, documentation, parameter and 
example files. An existing installation of earlier versions of XTrackCad is 
not overwritten. 

A new program group named XTrackCad 4.2.4 will be created in the Start menu. 

## Linux ##

XTrackCAD for LINUX is shipped as a RPM file and a self extracting archive.
You will need libc6, X11R6, GTK+2.0, webkitgtk.

### Installing from the RPM package. ### 

Use your operating system's package manager to install XTrackCAD.

### Installing from the self-extracting archive. ###

After downloading open a command line then 

    ./xtrkcad-setup-4.2.4.x86_64.sh --prefix=/ --exclude-subdir

This will install the executable in /usr/local/bin. A directory named 
xtrkcad will be created in /usr/local/share and all files will be unpacked
into it.

If you install XTrackCAD into another directory, set the XTRKCADLIB 
environment variable to point to that directory.

# Building #
## Overview ##

The following instructions detail building XTrackCAD using CMake. CMake is a
cross-platform build system, available at http://www.cmake.org, that can be
used to generate builds for a variety of build tools ranging from "make" to
Visual Studio and XCode. Using CMake you can build XTrackCAD on Windows,
GNU/Linux, and Mac OSX using the build tool(s) of your choice.

### Building XTrackCAD on GNU/Linux ###

* Obtain the current sources from Mercurial; I assume that they are stored locally at
  "~/src/xtrkcad".
  Note that the correct URL for read-only access to Mercurial is
  <http://xtrkcad-fork.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/xtrkcad-fork/xtrkcad>
* Create a separate build directory; for these instructions I assume that
  your build directory is "~/build/xtrkcad".
* Run CMake from the build directory, passing it the path to the source
  directory:

    $ cd ~/build/xtrkcad
    $ ccmake ~/src/xtrkcad

* Press the "c" key to configure the build. After a few moments you will see
  four options to configure: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX,
  XTRKCAD_USE_GTK, and XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO.
* Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to control the build type. Enter "Debug" for a debug
  build, "Release" for a release build, etc.
* Use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to control where the software will be installed.
  For this example, I assume "~/install/xtrkcad".
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_GETTEXT to add new locales (language translations). Choose
  "OFF" to use XTrackCAD's default language (English). Refer to
  http://www.xtrkcad.org/Wikka/Internationalization for additional information.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK to control the user-interface back-end. Choose "OFF"
  for Windows, "ON" for all other platforms.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO to enable optional high-quality antialiased
  Cairo rendering for the GTK back-end. This option has no effect unless you are
  using the GTK back-end.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_DOXYGEN to enable the production of type, function, etc.,
  documentation from the the source code. Requires doxygen if enabled.
  Enable if and only if you intend to hack on the code. 
* If you made any changes, press the "c" key again to update your new
  configuration.
* Once everything is configured to your satisfaction, press the "g" key to
  generate makefiles for your build.
* Compile XTrkCad using your new build:

    $ make

* Install the new binary:

    $ make install

* Run the installed binary:

    $ ~/install/xtrkcad/bin/xtrkcad

* If XTRKCAD_USE_DOXYGEN was enabled:

    $ make docs-doxygen
  
  to create the internals documentation. Read this documentation by pointing 
  your web browser at ~/build/xtrkcad/docs/doxygen/html/index.html.

### Building XTrackCAD on Mac OSX ###

* You will need to install the following dependencies - I recommend using
  <http://www.macports.org> to obtain them:
  - GTK2
  - webkit
  - gnome-icon-theme 
* Once the prerequisites are installed the build instructions are the same
  as for the GNU/Linux build, above.
* Remember that to run XTrackCAD on OSX, you need to have X11 running with
  your DISPLAY set.

### Building XTrackCAD on Windows ###

* Obtain the current sources from Mercurial; I assume that they are stored locally at
  "c:/src/xtrkcad".
  Note that the correct URL for read-only access to Mercurial is
  <http://xtrkcad-fork.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/xtrkcad-fork/xtrkcad>
* Use the Windows Start menu to run CMake (cmake-gui).
* Specify the source and build directories in the CMake window. You must
  provide a build directory outside the source tree - I use "c:/build/xtrkcad".
* Press the "Configure" button to configure the build. You will be prompted
  for the type of build to generate. Choose your desired tool - I used "Visual
  Studio 10". After a few moments you will see three options to
  configure: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, XTRKCAD_USE_GTK, and XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO.
* Use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to control where the software will be installed.
  The default "c:/Program Files/XTrkCAD" is a good choice.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_GETTEXT to add new locales (language translations). Choose
  "OFF" to use XTrackCAD's default language (English). Refer to
  <http://www.xtrkcad.org/Wikka/Internationalization> for additional information.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK to control the user-interface back-end. Choose "OFF"
  for Windows.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_GTK_CAIRO to enable optional high-quality antialiased
  Cairo rendering for the GTK back-end. This option has no effect unless on
  Windows.
* Use XTRKCAD_USE_DOXYGEN to enable the production of type, function, etc.,
  documentation from the the source code. Requires doxygen if enabled.
  Enable if and only if you intend to hack on the code. 
* If you made any changes, press the "Configure" button again to update your
  new configuration.
* Once everything is configured to your satisfaction, press the "OK" button
  to generate project files for your build.
* Compile XTrackCad using the new project files. For example, start MSVC and
  open the "XTrkCAD.sln" solution file which is located in your build directory.
* Build the "BUILD_ALL" project to build the software.
* Build the "INSTALL" project to install the software.
* Run XTrackCAD by double-clicking its icon located in the install directory -
  for example: c:/Program Files/XTrkCAD/bin/xtrkcad.exe.
